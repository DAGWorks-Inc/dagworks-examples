# data\_processing

Shows a basic data processing example. This is a contrived example that requires some
'normalization' of data input and then a merging of two tables and subsequent processing. It is
basic, but shows a configuration based way to swap out a function, along with how one might
approach data quality checks.

## Getting started

To get started, all you have to do is run:

1. Ensure you have the right python dependencies installed.
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

2. Run the `run.sh` script.
```bash
./run.sh
```
