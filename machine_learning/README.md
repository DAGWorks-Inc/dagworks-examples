# machine\_learning

This template shows a ML pipeline. It shows how one could split up functions into modules. It also
shows how to use `@subdag` to fit different models in the same DAG run.

## Getting started

To get started, all you have to do is run:

1. Ensure you have the right python dependencies installed.
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

2. Run the `run.sh` script.
```bash
./run.sh
```
