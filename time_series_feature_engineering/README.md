# time\_series\_feature\_engineering

This is an example showing how one might start approaching time-series feature engineering. It is
based on code from [F33](https://www.f33.global/)'s [WaffleML repository](https://github.com/F33AI/waffleml-examples/tree/master/kaggle_store_item_demand_forecasting). 
It uses a sample of data from [this kaggle competition](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/demand-forecasting-kernels-only).

## Getting started

1. Ensure you have the right python dependencies installed.
